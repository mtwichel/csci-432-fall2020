# Extra Credit

EC needs to only be submitted to Gradescope as a PDF.

## General Requirements

Some assignments will have specific requirements.  However, for most events, use
the following guidelines:

Throughout this semester, you will have the opportunity to attend various
seminars or events, and write a brief reflection on them for extra credit.
These reflections should be written as a formal two-page paper.  You may
consider the following questions when writing your reflection, but there are no
specific formatting requirements:

* What did you learn?
* Were there any algorithms involved? (Even if not explicitly discussed).
* What is a piece of advise that you took away?
* Did an audience member ask a question that you particularly liked or disliked?
* Is there a question that you wish you could have asked but didn't?
* If related to the event, what were you thinking about as you were leaving?
* Did this event inspire you to look something up after the event? If so, what
  was it?
* Did you meet someone new at this event who you could see as a mentor / mentee
  / collaborator in the future?
* What is your take-away message from this event?

## Misc-01

I am invited to give a seminar on ``Fostering Collaboration among Research
Groups.''  On Monday, 24 August 2020, I will give a practice talk at 14:30. The
audience for this talk is PhD students and postdocs who are in the AISES
[Lighting the Pathway program](https://www.aises.org/content/lighting-pathway).
So, as an audience member, please put on your improv hat and pretend to be a PhD
student or postdoc interested in learning more about how to work in
collaborations.  I invite questions during the talk (where you would try to ask
questions that you could imagine that the participants would ask).  After the
talk, I will request feedback from the audience. Any/all feedback is welcome.
By 12:00 on Tuesday, you must submit a one-page summary of your feedback.  What
would work well is two bullet-point lists: one of what went well and one of what
could be improved.  (Note: usually, I would give one week for the write-up, but
the actual seminar will be on Wednesday, 26 August, and I would look forward to
improving my presentation based on your feedback).  Zoom link will be posted in
the course discussion board over the weekend.  I expect this session will be 1.5
hours.

## Misc-02

Due: 23 October 2020

The 2020 ADSA Annual Meeting is free to attend (Oct 14-16). To register and for more information, see [here](https://academicdatascience.org/adsa-meetings/annual-meeting)

If you would like to earn a point in the "Miscellaneous" category, you would need to attend + write a 3-page reflection (note: references, if you have them, don't count towards those three pages). This is an open-format submission. So, we welcome you to interpret "reflection" in the way that helps you get the most of this conference. Some suggestions are:

* Attend several talks/sessions and write 1-pagraph summaries of the sessions.
* Describe the relationship between material that we are covering / will cover in this class with what you see at the workshop. Be creative in finding those connections! They are there.
* Attend one talk and go deeper. Research the speaker. Who are they? What is their background? Their biggest achievement? What did they talk about? Are there related papers that you can find?
* Most of the virtual conferences have some form of networking. Network and share your experience with us. Who did you connect with? What did you talk about?
* Describe why attending this conference was relevant to you.
